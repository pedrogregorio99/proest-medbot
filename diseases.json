People working in certain trades are more likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the past.asbestos fibres are too difficult for the macrophages to break down.

The exact causes are not known but there are several factors thought to increase your risk of developing the condition.<br>As part of normal life, your joints are exposed to a constant low level of damage which can be repaired. However, in cases of osteoarthritis, the damage to the joints is not fully repaired and instead some of the cartilage in the joint can be lost, bony growths can develop, and the area can become slightly inflamed.<br>Contributory factors for osteoarthritis are age, family history and obesity.",

        "causes":"Osteoporosis causes bones to become less dense and more fragile and it can affect men and women. It's more common in older people, but it can also affect younger people.<br>Women are more at risk of developing osteoporosis than men because the hormone changes that occur in the menopause directly affect bone density. Oestrogen is essential for healthy bones and after the menopause, oestrogen levels fall. This can lead to a rapid decrease in bone density.<br>In most cases, the cause of osteoporosis in men is unknown. However, there's a link to the male hormone testosterone, which helps keep the bones healthy. Men continue producing testosterone into old age, but the risk of osteoporosis is increased in men with low levels of testosterone.",

These feelings may be obvious soon after the event or they may be triggered unexpectedly years later.<br>Genetics - Having a close family member with panic disorder is thought to increase a person's risk of developing it. However, the precise nature of the risk isn't known.<br>Neurotransmitters -  It's thought that an imbalance of these chemicals may increase your risk of developing conditions such as panic disorder.<br>Increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide - Some experts believe that panic disorder is linked to an increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide. Breathing in air with high carbon dioxide levels can bring on panic attacks, and breathing techniques can help to relieve or stop panic attacks.",
        "consequences": "The main aim in treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks and ease the severity of symptoms. Psychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder.<br>Cognitive behavioural therapy - Psychological therapy has proven long-term benefits and it's recommended for treating panic disorder. It will usually take the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT is thought to be one of the most effective psychological treatments for panic disorder. It involves having regular sessions with a therapist.<br>Support groups - Support groups can provide useful information and advice about how you can effectively manage your panic disorder. They're also a good way of meeting other people who've had similar experiences of the condition.<br>Antidepressants - Antidepressants are often associated with depression, but they can also be used to treat a number of other psychological conditions.",
        "prevention": "There are several self-help techniques you can use to help treat and prevent the symptoms of panic disorder yourself.<br>Focus - If you have a panic attack, remind yourself that the frightening thoughts and sensations will eventually pass.<br>Slow deep breathing - While you're having a panic attack, try to focus on your breathing. Feelings of panic and anxiety can get worse if you breathe too quickly. Try breathing slowly and deeply while counting to three on each breath in and out.<br>Relaxation - Learning to relax can help to relieve some of the tension caused by panic attacks, and it may also help you to deal more effectively with your panic attacks when they occur.<br>Exercise and Diet - Regular exercise, particularly aerobic exercise, will help reduce stress and release tension. You should also maintain a healthy, balanced diet, eat regularly and avoid eating sugary food and drinks",

        "consequences": "There are several therapies that can make living with Parkinson's disease easier and help you deal with your symptoms on a day-to-day basis.<br>Physiotherapy - A physiotherapist can work with you to relieve muscle stiffness and joint pain through movement (manipulation) and exercise.<br>Occupational therapy - An occupational therapist can identify areas of difficulty in your everyday life ‚Äì for example, dressing yourself or getting to the local shops. They can help you work out practical solutions, and ensure your home is safe and properly set up for you.<br>Speech and language therapy - Many people with Parkinson's disease have swallowing difficulties and problems with their speech.
