It can take several months of treatment before acne symptoms improve.<br>Prescription medications that can be used to treat acne include topical retinoids, antibiotics and azelaic acid.<br>Several treatments for acne don't involve medication. These include a comedone extractor (small instrument used to clean out blackheads and whiteheads), chemical peels (chemical solution applied to the face, causing the skin to peel off and new skin to replace it) and photodynamic therapy (light is applied to the skin in an attempt to improve symptoms of acne).",
        "prevention": "Here's what you can do:<br>Don't wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day.<br>Wash the affected area with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse.<br>Don't try to 'clean out' blackheads or squeeze spots.<br>Avoid using too much make-up and cosmetics and make sure to remove them before you go to bed.<br>Wash your hair regularly and try to avoid letting your hair fall across your face.<br>And remember, treatment for acne depends on how severe it is and it can take several months of treatment before acne symptoms improve.

Treatment reduces the length of time you're contagious, speeds up recovery and lowers the risk of complications of scarlet fever.<br>Scarlet fever is usually treated with a 10-day course of antibiotics. This is often in the form of penicillin or amoxicillin tablets, although liquid may be used for young children. For people who are allergic to penicillin, alternative antibiotics such as erythromycin can be used instead. Fever usually gets better within 24 hours of starting antibiotics, with the other symptoms disappearing within a few days.<br>Make sure you also drink plenty of cool fluids, eat soft foods, take paracetamol to bring down a high temperature and use calamine lotion or antihistamine tablets to relieve itching.",

        "definition":"Threadworms, also known as pinworms, are tiny parasitic worms that infect the large intestine of humans. They don't always cause symptoms, but people often experience itchiness around their bottom or vagina. It can be worse at night and disturb sleep.",
        "causes":"A threadworm infection is passed from person to person by swallowing threadworm eggs. Threadworm infections most commonly affect young children because they often forget to wash their hands and they share toys with other children.<br>A female threadworm can lay thousands of tiny eggs around the anus or vagina. The female threadworm also releases mucus, which can cause an itchy bottom. If you don't wash your hands, the eggs can be transferred to your mouth or on to food or objects, such as toys and kitchen utensils. If someone else touches a contaminated object, or eats contaminated food and then touches their mouth, they'll become infected.",
        "consequences":"To treat threadworms successfully, all household members must be treated, even if they don't have any symptoms. This is because the risk of the infection spreading is very high. The aim of treatment is to get rid of the threadworms and prevent reinfection.<br>Mebendazole is the main medication used to treat threadworm infections. It can be bought over the counter from your local pharmacy or prescribed by your doctor (please talk to him first!).<br>Strict hygiene measures can help clear up a threadworm infection and reduce the likelihood of reinfection. The lifespan of threadworms is approximately 6 weeks, so it's important that hygiene measures are followed for at least this length of time. Here's some extra <a href='https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/threadworms#treating-threadworms' target='_blank'>information<a/> for you!",
        "prevention":"It's not always possible to prevent a threadworm infection, but you can significantly reduce your risk by always maintaining good hygiene and encouraging children to do the same. Children should wash their hands regularly, particularly after going to the toilet and before mealtimes. Kitchen and bathroom surfaces should be kept clean. If your child is infected, encouraging them not to scratch the affected area around their anus or vagina will help prevent reinfection and reduce the risk of the infection spreading to others.",

    "thyroid cancer":{
        "definition":"Thyroid cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the thyroid gland, a small gland at the base of the neck. The most common symptom of cancer of the thyroid is a painless lump or swelling that develops in the neck. Other symptoms only tend to occur after the condition has reached an advanced stage, and may include unexplained hoarseness that lasts for more than a few weeks, a sore throat or difficulty swallowing that doesn't get better and a lump elsewhere in your neck.",
        "causes":"In most cases, the exact cause of thyroid cancer is unknown. However, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing the condition, including having another thyroid condition and being exposed to radiation.<br>The main risk factors for developing thyroid cancer are having a thyroid condition, having a family history of thyroid cancer, having a bowel condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis, acromegaly, having previous benign (non-cancerous) breast conditions or radiation exposure.",
        "consequences":"If you're diagnosed with thyroid cancer, you'll be assigned a care team, who will devise a treatment plan for you. Your recommended treatment plan will depend on the type and grade of your cancer, and whether your care team thinks that a complete cure is realistically achievable.<br>In almost all cases of thyroid cancer it's necessary to either remove some of your thyroid gland in a procedure called a hemithyroidectomy, or all of your thyroid gland (total thyroidectomy). This decision will be influenced by the type of thyroid cancer you have, the size of the tumour and whether or not the cancer has spread beyond your thyroid gland.<br>If some or all of your thyroid gland is removed, it will no longer be able to produce the hormones that regulate your metabolic system. This means you'll experience symptoms of an underactive thyroid, such as fatigue, weight gain and dry skin. To compensate, you'll need to take replacement hormone tablets for the rest of your life - Replacement hormone therapy.",
        "prevention":"From the available evidence, eating a healthy, balanced diet is the best way to avoid getting thyroid cancer and all other types of cancer. A low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least five portions a day) and whole grains.",

        "causes":"Toothache occurs when the innermost layer of the tooth (dental pulp) becomes inflamed. The pulp is made up of sensitive nerves and blood vessels. Dental pulp can become inflamed as a result of tooth decay, a cracked tooth, loose or broken fillings, receding gums and periapical or periodontal abscess.",
        "consequences":"The type of treatment you have for toothache will depend on the cause of the pain, so your dentist will examine your mouth and may carry out an X-ray to try to identify the problem. If your toothache is caused by tooth decay, your dentist will remove the decayed area and replace it with a filling. If your toothache is caused by a loose or broken filling, the filling will be taken out, any decay will be removed, and a new filling put in place.<br>If the pulp inside your tooth is infected, you may need root canal treatment. This procedure involves removing the infected pulp and then inserting a special type of filling to seal the tooth and prevent reinfection. Your tooth may need to be removed if the toothache can't be treated using these methods or the tooth is wedged between another tooth and your jaw (impacted).",
        "prevention":"The best way to avoid getting toothache and other dental problems is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. To do this, you should limit your intake of sugary foods and drinks, brush your teeth twice a day using a toothpaste that contains fluoride, clean between your teeth using dental floss and, if necessary, use a mouthwash and don't smoke ‚Äì it can make some dental problems worse.<br>Make sure you have regular dental check-ups, preferably with the same dentist. Children should have a dental check-up every six months so tooth decay can be spotted and treated early.",

While TB is a serious condition that can be fatal if left untreated, deaths are rare if treatment is completed.<br>If you‚Äôre diagnosed with active pulmonary TB (TB that affects your lungs and causes symptoms), you will be given a six-month course of a combination of antibiotics.<br>Extrapulmonary TB (TB that occurs outside the lungs) can be treated using the same combination of antibiotics as those used to treat pulmonary TB. However, you may need to take them for 12 months.<br>Latent TB is when you have been infected with the TB bacteria, but do not have any symptoms of active disease. Treatment for latent TB is usually recommended for anyone aged 65 or under.",
        "prevention": "The BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin) vaccine can provide effective protection against TB in up to 8 out of 10 people who are given it.<br>Currently, BCG vaccinations are only recommended for groups of people who are at a higher risk of developing TB.

        "causes":"Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body is unable to produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that's needed to control the amount of glucose in your blood.<br>ype 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. Your immune system mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them, destroying them completely or damaging them enough to stop them producing insulin.<br>It's not known exactly what triggers the immune system to do this, but some researchers have suggested that it may be due to a viral infection. Type 1 diabetes is often inherited, so the autoimmune reaction may also be genetic.",
        "consequences": "Treating type 1 diabetes implies making sure that your blood glucose level is as normal and stable as possible. You'll be able to manage this using insulin treatment and by eating a healthy, balanced diet, but you will also have to regularly check your blood glucose levels to make sure they're not too high or too low.<br>In most cases, you'll need to check your blood glucose levels during the day, both at home and at work or school, using a simple finger prick blood test.",
        "prevention": "Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented but it is very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because it will get progressively worse if left untreated. If diabetes is left untreated, it can cause a number of different health problems.

Urinary incontinence affects both men and women, but it tends to be more common in women overall. There are several types of urinary incontinence, but the most common are stress incontinence and urge incontinence. The reason your detrusor muscle contracts too often may not be clear, but possible causes include drinking too much alcohol or caffeine, poor fluid intake, constipation or other conditions, such as neurological.",
        "causes":"Urinary incontinence occurs when the normal process of storing and passing urine is disrupted and this can happen for a number of reasons.<br>Stress incontinence occurs when the pressure inside your bladder as it fills with urine becomes greater than the strength of your urethra to stay closed. Any sudden extra pressure on your bladder, such as laughing or sneezing, can then cause urine to leak out of your urethra. These problems may be caused by damage during childbirth, increased pressure on your tummy, damage to the bladder or nearby area during surgery or neurological conditions.<br>The urgent and frequent need to pass urine can be caused by a problem with the detrusor muscle in the wall of the bladder.
